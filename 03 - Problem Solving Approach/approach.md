## Algorithm
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

To solve the algorithm in a very efficient way, we need __Data Structures__.

## Improve yourself

- devise a plan for solving problems
- master common problem solving patterns
    - understand the problem
      - restate the problem in our own word
      - identify the i/p and o/p
      - identify the important part of the problem
    - explore concrete examples
      - how i/p and o/p are connected
      - explore the connection in the examples
      - explore examples with
        - empty inputs
        - invalid inputs
        - edge case scenarios
    - break it down
      - think about the code or the approach before actually writing it
      - write the steps using comments/pseudo-code
      - identify the operations/steps
    - solve/simplify
      - write a simplified solution
      - solve the easy blocks first
      - incorporate the difficult logic after completing the easy one
    - look back and refactor
      - handle the edge case scenarios
      - try to optimize the code
      - proper comments
      - make it readable
    - example
      - [01-count-chars.js](./examples/examples.html#01-count-charsjs)
