# Patterns

Patterns are useful to solve the problems of a kind in an easier way

## Frequency Counter Pattern

This pattern is useful when we need to collect the values or frequencies of the values using objects or sets.

- It can help us to avoid O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- It is used when we want to search or iterate through an array (iterator) and it depends on an another array so to avoid nested loops, it can be used
- examples
  - 01-sameSquareArray.js
  - 02-validAnagram.js


## Multiple Pointer Pattern

This pattern is useful when we need to traverse an array towards beginning, end or middle on a certain condition

- It can be applied when array is sorted _(not necessarily)_
- example
  - 03-sumZero.js
  - 04-countUniqueValues.js
